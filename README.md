# ARKEND

**ARKEND** is a modular web project designed to serve as a knowledge base for the Dungeons & Dragons universe. The goal is to create a clean, fast, and developer-friendly foundation for building and trace DnD content such as classes, races, spells, monsters, and campaign tools.


## ðŸ§± Project Structure
